# Sign-Up

Hey, I'm Alberto Alvarado (Systems Engineer)

In this project, I will develop a sign-up form using all the knowledge I've learned in HTML, CSS and JavaScript so far in "The Odin Project".

Basically, this project will contain some validations in the input elements and I'm goint to use css properties and other css concepts I have
learned recently.
